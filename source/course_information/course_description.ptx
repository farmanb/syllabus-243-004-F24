  <p component="4083">
    Fundamental set concepts, groups, rings, integral domains, fields, polynomials.
  </p>
  <p component="S25">
    This course provides a hands-on introduction to formal verification and computer-assisted proof development using the Lean theorem prover.
    You will learn how to represent mathematical concepts in a precise formal language, construct and verify proofs interactively, and leverage automated techniques to eliminate logical errors.
    Along the way, you’ll explore core ideas from logic, type theory, and proof strategies that can be applied to create robust formalizations of everything from classical theorems to complex software specifications.
