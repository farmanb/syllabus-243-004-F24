  <title>Student Learning Outcomes</title>

  <p component="4083">
    The primary goal of this course is to gain familiarity with basic algebraic structures (groups, rings, and fields) and how they interact with one another (actions, homomorphisms, etc.). An equally important goal of this course is to improve students’ ability to read and write mathematical proofs.
  </p>
  
  <p component="308">
    The student will demonstrate proficiency the ideas and techniques of Linear Algebra by performing adequately on a series of exams and homework exercises.
  </p>
  
  <p component="243">
    The student will become proficient in vectors and the geometry of space, vector functions, and multiple integration.
    This proficiency will be demonstrated by satisfactorily completing a series of exams and homework assignments.
  </p>

    <p component="S25">
    Mathematics students will see how formalizing arguments in Lean can reveal hidden assumptions, refine logical thinking, and spark fresh insights, even for well<ndash/>known theorems.
    Lean also serves as a platform for cutting<ndash/>edge mathematical research, with extensive libraries of verified results that encourage meaningful contributions.
    </p>

    <p component="S25">
      Computer Science students will discover how Lean’s type<ndash/>theoretic foundations apply to verifying algorithms, cryptographic protocols, and large<ndash/>scale software systems, reinforcing a correctness<ndash/>first mindset essential to modern development.
    </p>

    <p component="S25">
      By the end of the course, you will be prepared to produce fully machine<ndash/>checked proofs, apply formal methods to real<ndash/>world challenges, and collaborate effectively with mathematicians and software engineers alike, bridging the gap between theoretical vision and practical reliability.
